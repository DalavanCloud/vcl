Management node conditional system requirements:
- xCAT provisioning
  In order to provision bare-metal or physical computers, xCAT must be installed
  and properly configured. This release supports xCAT 2.x. Imaging support using
  xCAT 2.x requires additional files. To enable imaging for xCAT 2.x, see the
  page describing how to add support for partimage and partimage-ng in the
  Apache VCL wiki. 
- VMware vCenter provisioning
  In order to provision virtual machines on VMware vCenter you will need the
  vSphere SDK for Perl. This can be obtained from:
  http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/viperltoolkit/
  This is not required if provisioning virtual machines on standalone VMware ESX
  or ESXi hosts.
- Windows XP & Windows Server 2003 bare-metal provisioning
  The Sysprep utility is required to provision Windows XP and Windows Server
  2003 bare-metal images. The utility can be downloaded from Microsoft. It is
  included in newer versions of Windows. Sysprep is not required to provision
  virtual machine images.
- Jabber notifications
  VCL has the ability to send instant message notifications using Jabber. This
  feature is optional and can be enabled or disabled by configuring the
  "jabber=[yes|no]" property in the vcld.conf file. If the Jabber notification
  feature is enabled, the Net::Jabber Perl module is required.
