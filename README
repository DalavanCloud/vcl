Management Node Backend Conditional System Requirements:
- Bare-metal and virtual machine provisioning
  Both bare-metal and virtual machine provisioning require a DHCP server running
  on the management node listening on the private network.
- Bare-metal provisioning
  If you want to provision bare-metal or physical computers such as blades. You
  will need xCAT setup and working. This release supports either xCAT 1.3 or
  xCAT 2.x. This is useful for very large setups, very custom environments, HPC
  integration, automating VM host servers either ESX standard or VMware Free
  Server. Imaging support using xCAT 2.x is an add on feature. To enable imaging 
  for xCAT2.X See adding support for partimage and partimage-ng to xCAT 2.x in the vcl apache wiki. 
- VMware virtual machine provisioning
  If you want to provision virtual machines on ESX,ESXi, or VMWare Free server 2.x you will need the
  VMware vSphere toolkit. This toolkit can be obtained from:
  http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/viperltoolkit/
  This toolkit is a set of Perl modules. The toolkit is not required if using
  VMware Free server 1.x.
- Windows XP/2003/Vista//7/2008
  If provisioning Windows OS on bare-metal, you will need the following:
  - Sysprep - used for preparing Windows environments before an image is
	 captured
- Jabber Instant Message Notification(optional)s
  VCL has the ability to send instant message notifications using Jabber. This
  feature is optional and can be enabled or disabled by configuring the
  "jabber=[yes|no]" property in the vcld.conf file. If Jabber notification
  feature is enabled, the following Perl modules need to be installed:
  - Net-Jabber
